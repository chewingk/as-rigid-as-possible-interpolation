# As-rigid-as-possible Interpolation
[Project Report](https://chewingk.github.io/docs/AsRigidAsPossibleInterpolation.pdf)

## Introduction
Interpolation of two objects is a useful technique. For example, given two images of the same place, taken at different time of a day, and by interpolation it can create many new shots at different light level. It can also be used on interpolating shapes. In computer animation and games, there are many situations where an object changes it shape completely, and the entire transformation is animated. This can be achieved by artists manually putting frames together, but interpolation techniques can help doing it, making the process a lot more efficient and lower cost. This report is going to explore different interpolation methods, to see how they perform and how the results look like comparing to each other.
